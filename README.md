## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
It is a login screen simulation prepared for the Üsküdar University application. These app developers were shown how a user can log in using Firebase in a mobile app. The user can log in to the application in 3 ways. The first of these is anonymous login. To use this, we used the 'signInAnonymously' method provided by Firebase. This method allows the user to log in with a special ID given by Firebase when he clicks the button. After the user logs in, this person's record is stored in the database by Firebase to be shown to the app owner. The second login method is the method in which the user logs in with an e-mail and password that he has determined. To use this method, a user must first be created. After this user is made, the user record is stored by Firebase. When the user wants to log in later, he can log in with this e-mail and password. However, in our application, the user is requested to verify their e-mail address. Otherwise, it is blocked from logging into the application. Mail and password fields were created with the 'TextFormField' widget. A validation process is performed in all of these areas. We used the package named 'email validator' for mail control. This package tests the accuracy of the e-mail entered by the user. It warns the user if the test fails. Apart from that, the user is prevented from specifying less than 8 digits of their password. This allowed the creation of stronger passwords. Apart from that, error handling techniques were used in these areas. Errors that occur during operations are captured with the 'catch' block and displayed to the user with the help of an 'AlerDialog'. We used the 'awesome_dialog' package for 'AlertDialog'. In addition, we have added a menu in case the user forgets his password. Thanks to this menu, the user can receive a password reset e-mail to the e-mail address entered. But here, too, error handling techniques were used. In this way, if the e-mail address entered by the user is not in the Firebase database, an error message is displayed to the user. After the correction is made, the user can receive mail. Finally, the user can log in to the application with their Google account. In this way, he can use his existing account without creating a new user in the application. We have made the management of the application faster to communicate with the 'Provider' package. We used the 'flutter_svg' package to be able to use the 'SVG' format of the image that appears in the main menu. In this way, we were able to use better-quality photos. Finally, we improved the code readability and management of the application.<br><br>
